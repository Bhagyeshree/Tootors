# Tootors
Tootors is an Android app that helps students (consumers) find tutors (providers). Providers can be teachers, other students, or professionals who would like to offer their services to help tutor a student of any age. The provider will register, list their subjects they teach and their hourly rate. Consumers are the college or high school students or parents seeking help for their child to be tutored. They can use the app to see who the nearest tutors are and the amount they are willing to spend for tutoring service. They can schedule for tutoring service through the app.
